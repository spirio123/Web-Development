                programming skills. Learn to configure your laptop environment,
                basic PC and troubleshoot problems. Students create backups,
                install virus protection, and manage files through a basic
                understanding of the Windows Operating System. Students also
                install and configure the Windows Operating System, and a
                virtual machine environment and explore computer organization
                including basic numerical systems, functional hardware and
                software components needed to run programs.

                programming language structure provides a solid foundation for
                further study in the field. Students develop introductory
                knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on problem
                analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts,
                UML Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java programming
                language used as a means to implement problem solution designs.
                Through an introduction to the Java programming language
                students use sequential structures, selection structures,
                repetition structures, variables, constants, methods,
                constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented
                programming, classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation,
                inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is
                reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory
                assessments.

                Databases are used to store data and are a core component of
                many information technology systems. Students learn the
                fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity
                Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and use Structured Query Language
                (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. Students design
                and create databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable
                to change in business requirements, using normalization.
                Students become familiar with the functions of a Database
                Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison with
                legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.

                choices that challenge each of us to find our place as
                contributing citizens in the emerging society. Life in the 21st
                century presents significant opportunities, but it also creates
                potential hazards and ethical problems that demand responsible
                solutions. Students explore the possibilities ahead, assess
                their own aptitudes and strengths, and apply critical thinking
                and decision-making tools to help resolve some of the important
                issues in our complex society with its competing interests.

                regardless of discipline or field of study. Using a practical,
                vocation-oriented approach, students focus on meeting the
                requirements of effective communication. Through a combination
                of lectures, exercises, and independent learning, students
                practise writing, speaking, reading, listening, locating and
                documenting information and using technology to communicate
                professionally. Students develop and strengthen communication
                skills that contribute to success in both educational and
                workplace environments.

                The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an
                essential prerequisite to Calculus. Students manipulate
                algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear
                systems and learn the properties of and graph algebraic and
                transcendental functions. Students investigate computer number
                systems in addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve
                problems involving computer systems. Students also study the
                addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components.
                Delivered in a modular format, this course is equivalent to the
                completion of all of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B,
